# Managing tabs in chrome was never so easier

##### Why manage bookmarks when you can manage tabs


**[ADD TO CHROME](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alltabs/fffhmhcillaopdbhllfffhfhbcnkioco)**

### Save All Tabs
Save your current open pages with one click. If you are in a hurry no need to give the file name. The current time will be the default file name so that you can easily identify the session.

### Open Any Tab Later
Open tabs one by one as per your priority, instead of opening all tabs.
